# Intermittent AsyncStorage Errors on Android in Expo

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using AsyncStorage in Expo, specifically on Android devices. The issue manifests as intermittent failures to save data or retrieve data unexpectedly returning null or undefined. The error messages provided are not very helpful in debugging.

## Bug Description

The primary problem is the inconsistent behavior of AsyncStorage on Android.  Sometimes data is saved and retrieved correctly; other times, either saving fails silently, or retrieving yields null/undefined, even if data was previously written.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the project on an Android emulator or device.
3. Observe the intermittent failures in saving and retrieving data from AsyncStorage.

## Solution

The solution involves migrating to a more reliable storage mechanism.  The provided `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates using MMKV, a high-performance key-value storage solution that addresses the issues observed with AsyncStorage.  MMKV is specifically designed for mobile apps and often provides a more consistent experience across platforms.

## Additional Notes

While this solution addresses the inconsistency, investigating the root cause of the AsyncStorage problem is still recommended for potential future improvements.  Factors such as device-specific issues, Android versions, and Expo SDK versions should be considered when further debugging.
