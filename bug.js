This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo and occurs only on Android. The error message is not very descriptive and can be difficult to track down, especially when it happens only sometimes. It might manifest as a failure to save data to AsyncStorage, or it might return null or undefined data unexpectedly, even if data was written earlier.
